# Bomberman
Bomberman in UE4!

## Controls
### Player1
Move - WASD
Place Bomb - Q

### Player2
Move - Arrow keys
Place Bomb - Num 0

## Notes
### Time spent
I spent roughly 17-18 hours on this project, including research.

### Future improvements
* Implement a viable scoring system. I was not able to do that in the timespan allotted.
* Implement various pickups. Though the player, map and bomb classes are modular in nature to accomodate pickups, I was not able to make pickups in the given time.
* Implementing a moving camera, one which doesnt show the whole game field all at once, but zooms in and out based on if both players are visible in its frustrum, and also moves to different places depending on where the players are.
* Allow players to choose their own colours. Player colour has already been exposed as an editable value, but the frontend for it is not ready.
* Patrolling enemies like the original bomberman.
* Fully featured AI enemy bombermen.
